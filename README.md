# ðŸ“œ Vintage

Apply a vintage filter to your image. All of the image processing is done on the client-side; no servers are being used.

Check it out here: https://vintage-image.vercel.app/.

I might come back to this project again as there's still more work to be done to get it close to that "vintage" feeling.

Also, `CanvasRenderingContext2D.filter` is not currently supported on MacOS and iOS Safari so finding a workaround is also something that remains.
