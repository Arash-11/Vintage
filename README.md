# ðŸ“œ Vintage

Apply a vintage filter to your image.

All of the image processing is done on the client-side; no servers are being used!

I will probably come back to this project again as there's still more work to be done to get it close to that "vintage" feeling. Two filters that need to be applied next are the blur and the vignetting effects -- `CanvasRenderingContext2D.filter` is handy but unfortunately, it's not supported on MacOS and iOS Safari at the moment.
